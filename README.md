# NodeJS Beginners Tutorial

**Welcome to my tutorial on NodeJS, for beginners.**

Having recently learned NodeJS myself, I wanted to use my experiences while learning
to create my own tutorials to present it in a unique light that may help other newcomers to Node.

Video Series on Youtube can be found here: *coming soon*

These files are not meant to be a tutorial in and of themselves, only a supplement to the youtube tutorials
I have been doing, so if you have any questions, check out the relavant video and see if you don't find the answer there.

Thanks Everyone, and Happy Coding!
