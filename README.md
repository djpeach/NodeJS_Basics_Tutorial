# NodeJS Beginners Tutorial

**Welcome to my tutorial on NodeJS, for beginners.**

Having recently learned NodeJS myself, I wanted to use my experiences while learning
to create my own tutorials to present it in a unique light that may help other newcomers to Node.

Video Series on Youtube can be found here: [Node.js Video Tutorials](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLqkA8i556jh96bPL9neuaN8Wx_VLGLNDT)
