# NodeJS Beginners Tutorial

**Welcome to my tutorial on NodeJS, for beginners.**

Having recently learned NodeJS myself, I wanted to use my experiences while learning
to create my own tutorials to present it in a unique light that may help other newcomers to Node.

Video Series on Youtube can be found here: *coming soon*

I hope you enjoy these tutorials. If you have questions on a tutorial, check out the corresponding video version! (_coming soon_)

Thanks Everyone, and Happy Coding!
